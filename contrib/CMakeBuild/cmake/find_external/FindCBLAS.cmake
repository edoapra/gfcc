# Find CBLAS
#
# At the moment this is a relatively thin wrapper.  Given the variability in
# BLAS distributions *cough* mkl *cough* find module attempts to provide the
# user a unified API to the returned CBLAS implementation by defining a C macro
# CBLAS_HEADER, which can be used in your source files like:
# `#include CBLAS_HEADER`, it's passed to your library via the
# `CBLAS_DEFINITIONS` cmake variable
#
# This module defines
#  CBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR, only the includes for CBLAS
#  CBLAS_INCLUDE_DIRS, all includes for CBLAS and its dependencies
#  CBLAS_LIBRARY,   only the CBLAS library
#  CBLAS_LIBRARIES, CBLAS library and those of its dependencies
#  CBLAS_DEFINITIONS, flags to include when compiling against CBLAS
#  CBLAS_LINK_FLAGS, flags to include when linking against CBLAS
#  CBLAS_FOUND, True if we found CBLAS
#
# Users can override paths in this module in several ways:
# 1. Set CBLAS_INCLUDE_DIRS and/or CBLAS_LIBRARIES
#    - This will not look for includes/libraries for CBLAS or its dependencies
# 2. Set CBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR and/or CBLAS_LIBRARY
#    - This will not look for includes/libraries for CBLAS, but will look for
#      includes/libraries for the dependencies
# 3. Set BLAS_INCLUDE_DIR and/or BLAS_LIBRARY
#    - This will look for includes/libraries for CBLAS, but not its dependencies
