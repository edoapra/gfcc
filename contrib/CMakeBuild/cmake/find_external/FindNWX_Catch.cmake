# Find NWX_Catch
#
# Catch doesn't by default install itself.  This script will find the
# Catch header file (catch/catch.hpp) and the catch library (catch/libcatch.so).
# The NWX just reminds us this isn't the canonical way provided by Catch
#
# This module defines
#  NWX_CATCH_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find catch/catch.hpp
#  NWX_CATCH_LIBRARIES, where to find libcatch
#  NWX_Catch_FOUND, True if we found NWX_Catch
