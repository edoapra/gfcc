#
# Attempts to find a LAPACK distribution.  This module will override the one
# that comes with CMake.
#
# After this module runs the following variables are set:
#   LAPACK_LIBRARY   : The LAPACK library(s)
#   LAPACK_LIBRARIES : The LAPACK library(s) plus those of any dependencies
#   LAPACK_FOUND     : True if we found a LAPACK library
#
# Users can override paths found by this module in several ways:
# 1. Specify LAPACK_LIBRARIES
#    - This will prevent attempts to find LAPACK or its dependencies and will
#      use the supplied paths instead
# 2. Specify LAPACK_LIBRARY
#    - This will not look for LAPACK, but will look for its dependencies
